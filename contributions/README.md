# Auto Contributions

This directory contains automatically generated contributions that help maintain a consistent contribution streak on GitHub.

## How it works

1. A GitHub Action runs daily at midnight UTC
2. Creates a new markdown file with the current date
3. Commits and pushes the changes to the repository

## Purpose

This automation helps maintain:
- Consistent contribution streaks
- Repository activity
- GitHub profile statistics

## Note

These are automated contributions and should not be considered as actual development work.
